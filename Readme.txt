ADDENDUM (May 2025)

### Psswd.py

The Password_search folder was created to incoprporate the list search and autofill funtionality into the password application.

The application HI was also modified to include the SEARCH SITES, SITE LIST and SITE INFORMATION areas to delineate different functionality. When searching for site, the SEARCH SITES and SITE LIST work together to find specific sites according to the letters entered in the SEARCH SITES field and autofilling the SITES LIST list. NOTE that taking this action will disable the SITE EDITING buttons.
Once the site is found and it is clicked in the SITES LIST, the SITES INFORMATION fields will be filled with the site information. By clicking or focusing on the SITES INFORMATION fields the SITE EDITING buttons are enabled for use.

The application will run as before if the SEARCH SITES field is not used and selecting a site is done through the SITE LIST directly. Erasing all characters from the SEARCH SITES field will return the application to the original SITES LIST and previous operation mode.

The Passwords application (psswd.py) and distribution file creation software was uploaded to Github from C:\Workarea\Python\Passwords_2\Passwords_search. The Psswd.exe file was created with auto-py-to-exe and distribution file Passwords_setup.exe with Inno as described below.


### Create the distribution file psswd.py -> psswd.exe -> Passwords_setup.exe

### Create the exe file with auto-py-to-exe

C:\Workarea\Python\Passwords_2\Passwords_search> auto-py-to-exe
This opens the hi and then enter
Sript location:C:/Workarea/Python/Passwords_2/Passwords_search/Psswd.py
Onefile: One Directory
Console Window:Windows based (hide the console)
Icon: N/A
Additional Files:
C:/Workarea/Python/Passwords_2/Passwords_search/password.enc
C:/Workarea/Python/Passwords_2/Passwords_search/key.key
C:/Workarea/Python/Passwords_2/Passwords_search/information.json
Advanced:N/A
Settings:N/A

DO NOT use the onefile option under the Onefile selection instead use the One Directory option.

This is the prefered method to create the Psswd.exe. This method uses the PyInstaller but also correct many issues with the PyInstaller plus there is a human interface to ease use of the PyInstaller commands.

### Create the distribution file with Inno ###

Create a Psswd.exe with auto-py-to-exe or PyInstaller and copy the psswd.exe and _internal folder into the \Inno folder.

Go to the windows start and type Inno, then select Inno Setup Compiler.

After the Inno Setup compiler opens in the welcome screen select Create a new script file using the Script Wizard.
